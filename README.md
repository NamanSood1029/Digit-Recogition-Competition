# Digit-Recogition-Competition

Submission for the Kaggle classification competition for the MNIST handwritten digit labelled dataset: This folder contains the submission attempt summary (without hyperparameter tuning).

The respective Jupyter notebook goes through the process of data acquisition, preprocessing, feature modelling, data cleaning and the machine learning pipeline followed. <b>A convolutional neural network is used along with data augmentation to get a more varied training dataset for better accuracy</b>. Tensorflow Backend is used along with Keras

<b>Challenge:</b>

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.
